# odin-library

For this project, I will build a simple interactive book list.

By the end of this project, you will be able to submit a form to add entries to the library array and display them on the table. Entries on the table will have an interactive status and delete functionality. 

Improvements in the future:
-save data to local storage
-panel on right with stats (total pages, # of books, etc)
-dark mode toggle
-more use of book.prototype
